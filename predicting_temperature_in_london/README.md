<h2>Project Description</h2>

As the climate changes around the world, the ability to predict changing weather is becoming more and more important.

In this project you will work on predicting the mean temperature in London. You will import, preprocess, and explore historical weather data and automate the training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models. This will be setup in an automated workflow using functions, utilizing methods from sklearn and MLflow.

This project involves:

* Reading in the data and determining the column names, data types and number of non-null values
* Cleaning the data by extracting data from the date column
* Performing exploratory data analysis by visualising key correlations between data points
* Filtering and selecting features
* Imputing and normalizing the data
* Machine learning training and evaluation
* Creating logs for each experiment
